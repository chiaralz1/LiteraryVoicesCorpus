# Literary Voices Corpus (LVC) - Linguistic Analysis

The linguistic analysis of the book reviews contained in the Literary Voices Corpus (LVC) 

# LVC Description 

The Literary Voices Corpus (LVC) includes 11,202 reviews written in Italian by amateur readers on the Amazon Books and GoodReads platforms. The reviews relate to books by six internationally renowned novelists: J.K. Rowling, S. King, J.R.R. Tolkien, J. Austen, S.J. Maas, and D. Brown. 
The Literary Voices Corpus is an expansion of the A Good Review dataset, which is described in Alzetta C., Dell’Orletta F., Miaschi A., Prat E. and Venturi G. (2023) “Tell me how you write and I’ll tell you what you read: a study on the writing style of book reviews”. In Journal of Documentation, 2023. DOI:10.1108/JD-04-2023-0073.
Reviews of novels by these authors already in the A Good Review corpus were integrated into the LVC. In addition, new reviews were collected specifically for this collection, to reach a minimum of 1,100 reviews per author from Goodreads and 800 reviews from Amazon.
