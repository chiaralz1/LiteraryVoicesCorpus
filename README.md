# Literary Voices Corpus (LVC) - Linguistic Analysis

The linguistic analysis of the book reviews contained in the Literary Voices Corpus (LVC) 

# LVC Description 

The Literary Voices Corpus (LVC) includes 11,202 reviews written in Italian by amateur readers on the Amazon Books and GoodReads platforms. The reviews relate to books by six internationally renowned novelists: J.K. Rowling, S. King, J.R.R. Tolkien, J. Austen, S.J. Maas, and D. Brown. We collected reviews for the same books from the two platforms. 

The Literary Voices Corpus is an expansion of the A Good Review dataset, which is described in Alzetta C., Dell’Orletta F., Miaschi A., Prat E. and Venturi G. (2023) “Tell me how you write and I’ll tell you what you read: a study on the writing style of book reviews”, in Journal of Documentation.

Reviews of novels by these authors already in the A Good Review corpus were integrated into the LVC. In addition, new reviews were collected specifically for this collection, to reach a minimum of 1,100 reviews per author from Goodreads and 800 reviews from Amazon.

# Current Repository

This repository contains the linguistic analyses of the reviews in LVC performed using the Profiling-UD tool http://linguistic-profiling.italianlp.it/
The analyses on GoodReads and Amazon Books reviews are kept in separate files. 

## File Description

Each file contains a linguistic analysis of book reviews published on Amazon Books or Goodreads. Every review is associated with a unique global identifier: a sequential number ranging from 1 to 6,600 for Goodreads reviews and from 1 to 4,602 for Amazon reviews. Additionally, each review is linked to the specific book it refers to, along with the book's identifier code, a review-specific ID that is unique within the set of reviews for that book, and the author of the reviewed book.

For detailed information regarding the set of linguistic features extracted from each review, please refer to  Brunato D., Cimino A., Dell’Orletta F., Montemagni S., Venturi G.
